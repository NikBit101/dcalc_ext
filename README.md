# Portsmouth Degree Calculator App

University of Portsmouth calculates final degree classification in three ways, and has recently added the Grade Point Average (GPA) to graduate's transcripts.  This app _indicates_ how module marks can combine to form a final degree classification, it also calculates an incicative GPA.

If you're a student, it may be interesting to see how your current/predicted grades might affect your final classification.  Remember too, that it's not all about the grades - they may show capability, but they can never reflect who you are or how well you'll fit & contribute to any team.

# New and Improved!

This is a new and improved version of the original [Portsoc's Dcalc](https://github.com/portsoc/dcalc).
This new version implements the following added features:
* The ability to input your UP number and have your modules and achieved grades automatically inputted.
* You can set a target grade and figure out the minimum grades you need to achieve in each module to reach that target following the best rule for your given grades.
* Modules that require extra work to bring your grade up are highlighted to you.
* Average for your Second Year modules, which gives a prediction for your Final Year Mark.
* As well as some lovely visual changes.



This is new version was developed by a group of Second Year, Software Engineering students:<br>
