# Portsmouth Degree Calculator App

University of Portsmouth calculates final degree classification in three ways, and has recently added the Grade Point Average (GPA) to graduate's transcripts.  This app _indicates_ how module marks can combine to form a final degree classification, it also calculates an incicative GPA.

If you're a student, it may be interesting to see how your current/predicted grades might affect your final classification.  Remember too, that it's not all about the grades - they may show capability, but they can never reflect who you are or how well you'll fit & contribute to any team.
